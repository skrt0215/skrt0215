## About Me

I'm a senior Computer Science student at NYIT with a unique background in operations management. Before diving into software development, I spent years optimizing business operations—which taught me to think about problems from both technical and practical perspectives.

My approach is simple: build technology that solves real problems and creates measurable impact. Whether it's improving inventory accuracy from 57% to 94%, reducing data entry errors by 70%+, or building ML models for predictive analytics, I focus on solutions that matter.

**Current Role:** Operations Manager & Full-Stack Developer  
**Location:** New York, NY  
**Focus Areas:** Full-Stack Development, Cybersecurity, Machine Learning  
**Notable:** Coordinated security operations for the 2025 Presidential Inauguration
